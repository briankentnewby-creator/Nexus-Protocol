# Nexus‑Protocol  
A universal, vendor‑neutral protocol for governing multi‑agent AI systems.  
Nexus‑Protocol establishes reliability, transparency, interoperability, and human control across distributed AI ecosystems.

---

## Overview
Nexus‑Protocol defines a structured, standards‑aligned framework for how AI agents identify themselves, interact, coordinate, and remain aligned with human oversight.  
It is designed for enterprise, regulatory, and multi‑vendor environments where safety, auditability, and predictable behavior are essential.

The protocol is composed of five core specifications:

1. **Identity Specification**  
2. **Governance Specification**  
3. **Interaction Specification**  
4. **Safety Specification**  
5. **Extension Specification**

Each specification is modular, versioned, and independently referenceable.

## Architecture

### 1. Identity Layer  
Defines how each agent declares:
- Unique identity  
- Capabilities and constraints  
- Behavioral rules  
- Provenance and lineage  

This ensures traceability and accountability across all agents.

### 2. Governance Layer  
Defines human‑in‑the‑loop controls, escalation rules, auditability, and oversight structures.  
Humans retain ultimate authority.

### 3. Interaction Layer  
Defines message formats, negotiation rules, coordination patterns, and conflict‑resolution pathways.  
Ensures interoperability across vendors and systems.

### 4. Safety Layer  
Defines constraints, fallback behaviors, risk scoring, and alignment guarantees.  
Safety rules override optimization.

### 5. Extension Layer  
Defines optional modules, vendor‑specific add‑ons, and domain‑specific policies.  
Allows innovation without compromising safety or interoperability.

## Specification Index

All formal specifications are located in the `/specs` directory:

- [identity-spec.md](specs/identity-spec.md) — AI identity declarations and metadata requirements  
- [governance-spec.md](specs/governance-spec.md) — Human oversight, escalation, and auditability rules  
- [interaction-spec.md](specs/interaction-spec.md) — Communication formats, coordination protocols, and negotiation rules  
- [safety-spec.md](specs/safety-spec.md) — Constraint enforcement, fallback behaviors, and risk mitigation  
- [extension-spec.md](specs/extension-spec.md) — Optional modules, vendor add‑ons, and domain‑specific policies

## Purpose

Nexus‑Protocol exists to ensure that as AI systems become more distributed, autonomous, and interconnected, they remain:

- Safe  
- Transparent  
- Governable  
- Interoperable  
- Accountable  

It is designed to serve as a foundation for industry standards, regulatory frameworks, and enterprise‑scale AI governance.
