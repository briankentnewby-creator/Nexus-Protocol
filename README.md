# Nexus-Protocol
A universal protocol for governing multi‑agent AI systems. Establishes clear rules, roles, and safeguards to ensure reliability, transparency, and human control.
## Configuration

Nexus‑Protocol defines a clear, vendor‑neutral configuration model for multi‑agent AI systems. Every implementation must include:

### 1. Identity Configuration
- Unique AI identity file (AIF)
- Declared capabilities and constraints
- Versioned behavioral rules
- Human oversight bindings

### 2. Governance Configuration
- Role definitions (Coordinator, Specialist, Auditor, Gatekeeper)
- Escalation paths and override rules
- Transparency and logging requirements
- Compliance checkpoints

### 3. Interaction Configuration
- Allowed communication channels
- Message‑passing rules and rate limits
- Shared context boundaries
- Conflict‑resolution mechanisms

### 4. Safety Configuration
- Guardrails and prohibited actions
- Reversibility and rollback requirements
- Human‑in‑the‑loop triggers
- Monitoring and anomaly detection

### 5. Extension Configuration
- Vendor‑specific modules (optional)
- Domain‑specific policies (optional)
- Integration adapters for enterprise systems

This configuration model ensures that all Nexus‑Protocol implementations remain interoperable, auditable, and aligned with human control.
